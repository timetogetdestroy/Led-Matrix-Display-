# Led-Matrix-Display-
This project demonstrates a software simulation of an LED Matrix Display using 8086 assembly language in EMU8086. It features a scrolling text effect where the message shifts dynamically across the screen. The implementation uses BIOS interrupts to control text positioning and rendering in 80x25 text mode.
